# Text Styling Fix - April 1, 2025

## Issue
When using string interpolation in text components (e.g., `"Counter Value: ${counter.value}"`), text styling was lost 
when the dynamic value changed. This happened because the native iOS component was replacing the styled text with unstyled
text during updates.

## Solution
Implemented a comprehensive fix in `DCMauiTextComponent.swift`:

1. **Root Cause**: When text content changed, the label's styling properties were being reset before new styling was applied.

2. **Fix Implementation**:
   - Preserved all existing text styling properties before updating content
   - Created a complete `NSAttributedString` with all styling attributes in one operation
   - Applied combined styling as a single operation instead of property-by-property updates
   - Ensured paragraph style, font, color and other properties were preserved during updates

3. **Key Changes**:
   ```swift
   // Store original properties
   let existingFontSize = label.font?.pointSize ?? 17
   let existingFontName = label.font?.fontName
   let existingColor = label.textColor
   let existingAlignment = label.textAlignment
   
   // Apply all attributes to the entire string in one operation
   attributedString.addAttributes(attributes, range: range)
   
   // Set the attributed text with all styling
   label.attributedText = attributedString
   ```

4. **Additional Improvements**:
   - Better handling of inherited styles when not explicitly specified in updates
   - Consistent application of paragraph styles and letter spacing
   - Proper font weight preservation during updates

## Impact
This fix ensures text components maintain all styling properties during dynamic content updates, making string interpolation
and reactive text updates work properly with all text styling options.

## Testing
Verified with dynamic counter updates, multiple style combinations, and nested interpolations.
